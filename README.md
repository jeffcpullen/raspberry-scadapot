# raspberry-scadapot
Raspberry Pi powered scada simulator for cyber challenges that want physical reactions for reaching exercise milestones

The plan is to have Pi control various displays and motors. Here is a list of some of the things I plan on working towards.
- 16x2 Display for "Traffic Signs" ie 'CONSTRUCTION AHEAD'
- Automotive Gauge Stepper Motor to that needs to fall into the middle 'Green' area to avoid some problem (Think meltdown or gas leak)
- Spinning motors that simulate fans or pumps needed to control heat
- LED indicators for warnings and alarms
- Servo to control draw bridge, train track, or other vital infrastructure
